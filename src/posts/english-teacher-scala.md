Across a 15-song set, London-based ‘English Teacher’ easily captivated the audience at the sold-out Scala. As 800 people watched the rising band’s biggest headline show to date, the band proved that they are worthy of their praise and deserve the crowds.

Lily Fontaine, the group’s frontwoman, controlled the crowd as if it were second nature. It was a polished set, the energy maintained throughout each performance and featured a mixture of fan-favourite releases (R&B, Song About Love) and some unreleased (Mastermind Specialism, Albatross, You Blister My Paint). The new music does not slow the pace though, or create distance between the band and the audience due to the tracks being unknown. They perform them, just like the released ones, with pure raw, intensity that it is hard not to be enraptured by their talent.

‘I’m Not Crying, You’re Crying’ is a perfect example of how they expertly play new music with a fierce, intimate and high-energy rendition that creates anticipation for their album (something Lily consistently hints towards during the set). The rawness of each song lends itself to a live setting, delivered phenomenally by a group putting 100% into their performance.

Their newest singles included some of the best moments of the night. Opening the show with ‘The World’s Biggest Paving Slab’ was a perfect choice, with the build-up to the energetic climax perfect for raising the energy of the crowd. ‘Nearly Daffodils’, their most recent release, had a Morrissey-esque moment for Lily as she walked around the stage singing with a bunch of Daffodils in her hand. The track exceeded all expectations, being taken to new heights in a live setting as they switch from singing with a slower, more normal pace with the guitar underneath to a faster, rockier tempo that is perfect for a live set.

English Teacher are a band that easily commands their audience. They are made to be heard live, their intensity essential to how they were able to maintain the crowd throughout the entire night, especially when playing tracks previously unheard. In a venue so small, with a band so loud, the crowd had no choice but to be completely immersed in the sonic world of English Teacher.

With a tight band, uncontained joy to be performing live and a stage presence like no other, English Teacher entrenched themselves as one of the most exciting live bands right now and it won’t be long until 800-capacity venues are a thing of the past.
