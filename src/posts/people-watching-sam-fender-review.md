**Sam Fender’s newest release People Watching sees the British musician soar to new heights. Ever since the release of his debut  [Hypersonic Missiles](https://northerntransmissions.com/sam-fender-shares-details-of-hypersonic-missiles/), Fender has been highlighted as one of the greatest talents to come out of the UK in the last decade. With Seventeen Going Under, he saw himself reach superstar levels in the country with the eponymous song going viral on TikTok. With prime slots at Glastonbury and Reading & Leeds and a sold-out arena tour, People Watching was highly anticipated but the pressure didn’t affect Fender, ultimately releasing a more ambitious, improved album filled with catchy and energetic songs.**

Sam Fender has, from his debut, been labelled as a story-teller. The influence of Bruce Springsteen has also run through each record and this influence on his sound and unique way of writing songs sets him out from others in the indie/alternative-rock genre. These claims are seen the most on the newest album though with the tracks being vulnerable, story-driven and passionate. The use of saxophone is, whilst not a new instrument for Fender, one that shines on the jaunty and upbeat tracks like ‘People Watching’, ‘Wild Long Lie’ and ‘Rein Me In’.

Fender’s greatest feat is how observational and yet deeply personal his songs are. He writes about everyday events and people, and on an LP that focuses on observing the everyday people of our world, his simple topics become something much more. He is able to turn the ordinary and the mundane into these exhilarating and extremely heartfelt anthems; anthems that everyone can relate to. Much like Springsteen, there is a deep emotional connection to both their hometown and the people that populate their world. Fender, who comes from North Shields near Newcastle, uses his origin and these people to tackle heavy, intimidating topics like heartbreak, equality and family. On ‘Nostalgia’s Lie’, the theme and emotions of your hometown is prevalent as he sings to return back to that place while also singing about accepting “the path that lies before me”.

‘Arm’s Length’ tackles those emotional connections between people, a prevalent topic for the modern age. With the choruses (tailor-made for crowds to sing loudly back) repeating: “Do you have to know me, know me inside out? … to have a good time?” The tracks build and build, and there is this bubbling of energy and anticipation before the chorus thunders in, delivering that cathartic release. ‘Arm’s Length’ is a perfect example, with the repetition of the choruses fuelling the ultimate, final blow of energy that unleashes at the climax of the song. ‘Little Bit Closer’ and ‘Rein Me In’ is another example with the lines from the latter ‘Now I’m working myself up to a nice warm bliss, all my memories of you ring like tinnitus. If I stop it’s just pain, please don’t rein me in.” The expanse of the song remains throughout, with there being this constant space and airiness. Despite all of the energy and instruments and passion, it never overwhelms the listener.

Fender excels in providing hope and optimism with his songs. This ability excels when the record is coupled with the relatability of the everyday and ordinary as it becomes even more relatable.’Chin Up’ is an uplifting anthem that does just that, starting off with the lines “I’m rising up with the sun” while Oasis’ ‘Wonderwall’-esque guitar chords play in the background.

The singer-songwriter doesn’t shy away from political and social commentary though. Hypersonic Missiles was filled with critiques of the British government at the time and ‘Aye’ from Seventeen Going Under is an angry and passionate critique. On the newest LP, the criticism runs throughout. On ‘Wild Long Lie’, the song kick-off with lines about protests, former prime minister Boris Johnson and the UK police force before moving onto themes of resisting your past. ‘TV Dinner’ is an angsty song filled with questions and introspective writing. Sonically, it is the greatest diversion from the colourful indie-rock tunes that make up the LP but there still remains the energy, albeit slightly more angry as he questions his place in the music industry; an industry that preys on its artists.

People Watching closes with a song dedicated to, and written about, his grandparents. Inspired by their love and close connection up to their death. It is emotional, with Fender singing passionately while an orchestra swells in the background. The fewer amount of instruments compared to the rest of the tracks emphasises how personal and vulnerable the song is with lines like “So humour me, make my day. I’ll tell you stories, I’ll kiss your face and I’ll pray you’ll remember my name,” that drive home the heartfelt nature of the song. As a closer, it shines a spotlight on the main topics of the record: love and connections with people; no matter how brief. A fitting end to a beautiful, fully realised and authentic record
