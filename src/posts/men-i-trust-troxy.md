Men I Trust, a dream-pop/shoegaze band from Montreal, Canada, performed a spectacular set at Troxy in London.

Following a sold-out show at the Roundhouse, expectations were high for this set. The moment the band took to the stage, the entire atmosphere changed as we were plunged into their world of dreamy synths and fuzzy guitar tones. Each song one-upped the previous, the group managing to capture the audienceâ€™s attention for the entire duration of their set.

Their stage presence was incredible. Their music was not one that needed a stage presence to be enjoyed but the stage lighting, a surprising highlight of the show that helped to create the dreamy, almost psychedelic atmosphere of the live music, combined with the performance itself helped to maintain full attention on the show.

The quality of the audio was not lost in the many pedals used, each member not only had a moment to shine with a guitar solo or instrumental break but was able to shine clearly throughout the entire show with each performer absolutely essential to creating the electropop sound.

  

Men I Trust may have finished their UK tour but do not miss their next tour. They are a poppier modern Cocteau Twins with a perfect balance between energetic, indie songs and slower, jazz songs. The energy never falters and attention remains solely on the band to deliver a spectacular setlist. The wall of sound they created during the live performance elevates the already atmospheric songs to a whole new level.
