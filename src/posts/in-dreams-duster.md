On August 30th, Duster surprised dropped their fifth album _In Dreams._ It builds upon their atmospheric and space-rock sound that they have become so well known for. The recognisable sound became even more popular when the band blew up online, with Duster receiving unprecedented amounts of streams of _Stratosphere_ which came out in 1998, with ‘Inside Out’ receiving 12.7 billion streams. At nearly 5 million monthly listeners, _In Dreams_ comes as the band’s first new release in two years.

  

Fans of the group will not be disappointed. The band have not reinvented the wheel nor do they switch genres. They stick to what they know and what they are passionate about, thus giving them the chance to further hone and craft the perfect sound. It’s an improvement from their last two albums, with the members feeling in sync and tight. But that’s not the biggest problem they face. With the huge success their debut LP found online in recent years, they will face comparisons back to it throughout this latest one and they will have to fight it in order for the record to be truly interesting and compelling.

  

At many points it does feel like the band could overwhelm the art itself, with the debut LP looming over them but the band fights back. What is carved out, throughout a record that could easily become monotonous, is a continually progressive yet familiar sound. With the pull of nostalgia so strong, Duster manage to make the project feel both totally familiar and recognisable as well as often times being new and innovative.

  

On songs such as ‘Quiet Eyes’ and ‘Close to Home’, Duster evoke strong emotions with the dreamy yet depressing guitar sound. The tones evoke atmosphere, and are the focus as they take precedent over the minimal lyricism, but they’re also emotional. The LP as a whole is immersive in this way, pulling the listener in and not letting go. The focus on instrumental and ambience makes it a perfect move soundtrack and the space-rock is often grounded into dreamy and fuzzy guitar chords, evoking the setting of a 2-am listening experience.

  

The lyricism mustn’t go amiss. On such a guitar and instrumental heavy record, the lyrics aren’t the focus - and that is the point. The way to evoke emotion and feeling and create the atmosphere required isn’t by singing about it, but by using the guitars and drums as the voice. The use of distortion, delay, chorus pedals and the such are key in understanding that but when coupled with writing, the band can evoke such a reaction with ease. On tracks like ‘Aqua Tofan’ and ‘Isn’t Over’, writers Clay Parton and Canaan Dove Amber use the writing as a way to further aid the instrumental ambient sound. Lines like “‘Cause you have always been enough … And now the loneliness is gone. It’s so much easier now’ (Isn’t Over) and “Float in the waste, I’m swimming back to you … If I’m not obsessed with us then everything falls through,” (Aqua Tofan) touch on and reinforce the consistent theme of loneliness and isolation that the album focuses on.

  

_In Dreams_ is a beautiful, serene and often dreamy album that is masterfully crafted to build atmosphere and evoke emotions of loneliness and sadness. These emotions are often tinged with hope and optimism, the warm fuzziness of some of the guitar pedals helping to craft such a contrast. Duster fight against the pull of nostalgia, something that is taken to extreme levels due to the unimaginable success that _Stratosphere_ has found in the past few years online. They use the nostalgia as a way to help with creating the feel and sound of the record, the duality of familiarity versus innovation feeding into the duality and contrast of loneliness and sadness versus hopeful optimism and ultimately happiness.

  

_In Dreams_ is currently out digitally but will receive a physical release on 6th December via Numero Group. This celebration, being released alongside a box set of past work, highlights how impactful Duster have been and the longevity their music has - showing that they’re the masters of ambient and atmospheric rock.
