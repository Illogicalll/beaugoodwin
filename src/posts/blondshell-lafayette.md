A few weeks after the release of the deluxe edition of her critically beloved debut album, Blondshell returned to the UK for two shows in Bristol and London. The additional songs added to the album helped flesh out the live set and showed the progression in her songwriting as well as her confidence on stage.

In the 600-capacity venue, Sabrina Teitelbaum (better known by her stage persona Blondshell) guided the audience through the 14 tracks planned for the evening. With the album played in full, accompanied by the 3 deluxe-edition songs, she also played an unreleased work titled ‘Man’ and a cover of ‘Deceptacon’ by Le Tigre.

Starting with ‘Veronica Mars’, Blondshell wastes no time in getting into the evening with the guitar and bass, along with the drums, captivating the audience and setting the show off quickly and loudly.

There is consistent momentum, each song serving as a catalyst with every instrument having a moment to shine and steal the show. Even with the slower and more intimate performances, ‘Sober Together’, ‘Dangerous’ and ‘It Wasn’t Love’, the energy of the night doesn’t suddenly stop and disappear as the attention gained from the rockier and faster performances allows for these tracks to be brief respites and to stop the possibility of exhaustion.

‘Kiss City’ and ‘Tarmac’, the last two performed before the encore, perfectly encapsulate the atmosphere and vibe of the night and showcases Blondshell’s ability to quickly flow from a slower pace to a more energetic and cathartic pace-examples in both of these tracks.

Finishing the evening’s performance with ‘It Wasn’t Love’ and ‘Salad’. ‘Salad’ closed the night with a bang, the chorus being echoed back by the crowd as the fan-favourite rock track screamed with guitars and thumping drums-the bassline driving the show to a loud close.

Blondshell’s show at Lafayette was loud, energetic and oftentimes intimate with Sabrina in complete control the entire time; being able to flow between each song and the vibe of them each with ease. There is a lot of promise and anticipation not just for her next album, but also for her next return to London after such a good show.
