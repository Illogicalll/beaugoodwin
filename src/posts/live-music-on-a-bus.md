When one thinks of live music, they’d typically picture a stage inside a venue that is designed for it. The O2, Madison Square Garden or any venue like that might come to mind. Thinking bigger, you might imagine a field that has been commandeered for a performance or a football stadium that has been taken over for the night – Wembley Stadium and Glastonbury or Coachella for example. One doesn’t picture a London bus however on Wednesday 18th December, just outside Wood Green station inside a double-decker bus repurposed for such an event, five performers played their songs to the crowd.

The unique setting added to the intimacy of the performances, with fairy lights and lamps dimly lit all around on the tables. The Christmas season also meant a touch of festive decoration and many of the performers chose to sing a Christmas song in the spirit of it only being a week away.

The stripped-back nature of the performances, having no pedals or effects and just an acoustic guitar and a microphone, meant that each artist was left bare and vulnerable. There was nowhere to hide when playing the songs but the vulnerability caused the emotions and meanings behind each song to be at the very forefront.

Opening the show was Hannah De Leuw who instantly set the stage and tone with her acoustic guitar and playful songs. The songs ranged from getting moths out of bedrooms to the pains of situationships yet there was a constant elegance. Regardless of the topic or the pace, there was a delicacy within the singing and in the way Hannah had written the tracks; causing even the more playful and less serious songs to take on a new life and demand the attention of the audience.

With the crowd warmed up and their attention won over, Fred Greaves followed on quickly after. Fred, the frontman of the indie band Sunda Blue, wowed the crowd with his heartfelt tracks. The beautiful chords complimented his singing style, all of which added further depth to the emotions of the songs and gave them a nuance that shined in the moment.

After finishing the set with a cover of Darlene Love’s ‘Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)’, there was a brief break before Elise McQueen graced the microphone. With songs about the impending end of a relationship and imbalances in love, the stripped-back nature of the performance once again shined. The audience was also treated to a preview of her new song that will come out next year. Elise was joined by a backing guitarist who played beautiful chords, the fingerpicking taking songs to new levels whilst Elise filled the sound out with her acoustic rhythm guitar and  [Phoebe Bridgers](https://northerntransmissions.com/watch-phoebe-bridgers-on-records-in-my-life/)-esque vocals.

Park Days was next up. Sam, who goes by Park Days for his solo work, is also the frontman of the band Dutch Criminal Record. Opening his set with a beautifully intricate instrumental, he then proceeded to play a mix of unreleased and released Park Days songs, all having a summery 2010 vibe. The upbeat and faster-paced songs revitalised the crowd, getting them hyped for the secret headliner to follow.

The final act of the night was a surprise but as the singer Natsuma plugged in her electric guitar, the crowd was already hooked. The vulnerability of the performance changed from the nature of a stripped-back, simple acoustic guitar and microphone setup and instead evolved into an electric Fender Telecaster and some pedals and loops. Natsuma, in a matter of seconds, crafted detailed backing tracks with the use of her loop pedal before proceeding to sing relatable yet still personal songs about seeing an ex again, yearning for someone and about how one can make London seem so quiet. The delicacy in the guitar playing builds each moment until we are rewarded with cathartic, loud guitar chords or the shredding of a guitar solo. The final song of the set, and of the night itself, was a duet with Hannah as they sang ‘Santa Baby’; ending the final show of the year on a festive and fun note.

The 18th show of Live Music on a Bus, and the final one of the year, showed itself to be totally unique and engaging. The new artists being given a platform to sing and showcase new music proved themselves with beautiful songs, crafted beautifully and performed with heart and passion. The bus added an interesting and memorable aspect to the night, setting itself apart from other venues and as one to watch in 2025; especially with the calibre of artists that play their shows and hone their talent.
