When artists die their work, their life and their death become almost mythical and often help propel them to new levels of posthumous fame. This happened with Amy Winehouse, Kurt Cobain and Jeff Buckley. Buckley released only one studio album in his life, *Grace*, and a handful of live compilations were released after he died. His attempt at a second LP ‘Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk’ was released in May 1998, a year after he died.

*Grace* is steeped in grandeur and legend. Buckley is consistently remarked as ethereal-whether that’s the handful of live performances, his lyrics, the creative riff writing or the emotionally charged singing; there is this underpinning of emotion and greatness beneath everything he does and it is easy to see how he has become mystified since death.
<br>
The album is a mixture of Buckley’s own writing and a handful of covers. These include ‘Lilac Wine’ by James Shelton, ‘Corpus Christi Carol’ (Traditional/Benjamin Britten) and most famously ‘Hallelujah’ by Leonard Cohen. These songs, despite not being original songs by Buckley, do not falter in the emotionally provocative performances seen in Buckley’s songs. They managed to co-exist on the record, not weakening or overshadowing the LP as a whole or the other tracks, and with the case of ‘Hallelujah’ Buckley received a boost in popularity and attention.
<br><br>
The beauty of *Grace* is that throughout it is honest - all emotions are bared and Buckley is completely vulnerable. This lends itself to these heartbreaking climaxes and bridges: the “It’s never over…” bridge in ‘Lover, You Should’ve Come Over’ being a perfect example of these intimate moments he allows the listener to enter into. The vocal performances for each of these impassioned moments on the LP vary from Buckley singing powerful crescendos like in the eponymous song to these quieter, almost whispering sections-seen in ‘Mojo Pin’. His vocal performance was so moving it led to Thom Yorke from Radiohead taking heavy inspiration and moulding his own style after hearing it. The control over his voice throughout each track, every note meant and never delivering an underwhelming line.
<br><br>
The lyrics are equally as vital as Buckley’s vocals in delivering an intimate experience. As mentioned before, the bridge to ‘Lover, You Should’ve Come Over’ is a popular and pertinent choice as it shows the culmination of lost and consequentially unrequited love. ‘So Real’ is another track that shows how Buckley is able to write lyrics so simply yet so beautifully; with the opening line ‘Love let me sleep…your simple city dress.’ The simplicity of the writing is linked heavily to the emotional vulnerability of Buckley’s songs. These are more than songs linked to certain moments of his life or feelings he’s experienced - it is more akin to that of poetic writing in his diary. 
<br><br>
The theme of love runs deep within the record. Written after a profound, tumultuous relationship of 2 years, *Grace* is a reflection of love and how one loves; in all its various forms. The striking images that are provoked by his lyrics or guitar chords linger in the listener’s minds to an almost uncomfortable extent of time, Buckley’s own self-reflection seeping into the listener’s mind as they hear about the failings of him as a lover and boyfriend but how eager he is to amend his mistakes. 
<br><br>
The guitar on this album is truly fantastic as it stands out, unique, amidst the already breathtaking vocals and lyricism. Buckley’s use of guitar alone is praiseworthy, with fantastic chord shapes thought of with guitarist Michael Tighe on the track ‘So Real’. These abnormal chord shapes and progression underpin the emotion of the song. The subtle use of the telecaster in ‘Mojo Pin’, the first song on the record, helps create the ghostly and eerie atmosphere. Quickly followed by ‘Grace’, Buckley pushes the guitar to its limits as he sings along with a riff that maintains a faster, adrenaline-pumping rhythm.
<br><br>
*Grace* is a classic album and a breathtaking debut, with each song considered a masterpiece worthy of the highest praise. For a first release to be so sonically and emotionally rich as ‘Grace’ is unheard of and there is no doubt why it is as revered as it is. There is beauty in every moment, every aspect of every song, and there is no doubt about the potential Buckley could not reach. To listen is to be privy to the most intimate of moments and thoughts. As Jeff Buckley said: “Grace is what matters in anything…It sort of keeps you alive.”
