Inhaler, the hottest thing to come out of Dublin since a wagon load of Guinness caught fire, rolled into Cambridge on Wednesday evening to have one last run through of their set ahead of Glastonbury this Friday (June 24).

Fronted by 22-year-old Eli Hewson, the band have been in a constant state of touring their debut album, _It Won’t Always Be Like This_, and as the crowd at the sold out show proved, it really won’t.  
  
The venues will need to get bigger and bigger as the word spreads about this amazing live act, especially once they have played the John Peel stage at Glastonbury this weekend.  
  
Eli shall be following in his father's footsteps as he is none other than Bono, lead singer with U2, who played the festival in 2011. But that is where the comparisons should stop as Inhaler have their own unique sound that they have forged together after meeting at St Andrew’s College in Blackrock, Dublin.

A very tight one-hour set saw them perform 12 songs, opening with the title track off the album, then moving with breakneck speed as the sweat dropped over the monitors.  
In appreciation, the crowd sang along to every song, with an electric performance of _My King Will Be Kind_ - and the new festival-friendly single _These are the Days_ was greeted as an established favourite despite only being released two weeks ago.

With a capacity of 850, Inhaler will not be able to play small venues like this for much longer, so if you were fortunate to catch this show then save your ticket stub and the phone footage for reminiscing about the time they played Cambridge.
