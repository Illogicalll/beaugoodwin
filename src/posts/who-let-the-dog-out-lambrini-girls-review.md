**Lambrini Girls, the Brighton-based punk duo consisting of Phoebe Lunny and Lilly Macieira, deliver a debut album filled with whirlwind guitars and lyrics that highlight the injustices and power imbalances of modern-day society.**

In the context of mainstream UK punk bands, there will always be comparisons back to  [Idles](https://northerntransmissions.com/idles-collaborate-with-danny-brown/), however, to compare Lambrini Girls in such a way would be reductive to their unique energy, story and aims. Their highly emotive lyrics, best represented by lead vocalist Phoebe’s singing style, feel similar to the energy from the 90s. With speeches from Angela Davis placed between ‘You’re Not From Around Here’ and ‘Filthy Rich Nepo Baby’, the political and social commentary is impossible to ignore. The intersectionality of issues, something Davis touches on in her book ‘Women, Race and Class’, is also present on the LP with song topics ranging from injustice in the policing system, sexual harassment in the workplace and the housing crisis.

Whilst anger runs through the record, there is also a playfulness. On ‘Cuntology 101’, the word ‘cunty’ has been repurposed to an empowering term rather than something degrading, and in doing so there is an ability to look at what is said to women who aren’t behaving conservatively or being ‘modest’.This is a serious issue that is handled delicately but also playfully. It’s a balance that is pulled off with upbeat instrumentation and the backing vocals that echo during the chorus. The track ‘No Homo’ is also upbeat and playful, with a pop-punk tone being achieved.

This is a contrast to some of the heavier, grungier songs. The opener ‘Bad Apple’ begins with sirens before the drums and guitars kick in, quickly building pace. It’s filled with energy, as every song is, but there is anger present that isn’t as present on the playful, upbeat tracks – this is shown in the breathlessness of the singing. Phoebe sings in a way that manages to capture a moment. It feels like a recreation of the energy and atmosphere that would be present at their live shows and in managing to recreate that vibe, the LP feels very honest and raw – not at all sterilised and overly-polished

Both ‘Company Culture’ and ‘You’re Not From Around Here’ tackle the social issues of sexual harassment and the housing crisis/gentrification respectively. The guitar riffs have a life of their own, feeling like a tornado as it rocks through the song wreaking havoc, ultimately sucking the listener in. On ‘Filthy Rich Nepo Baby’, the drums take centre stage, elevating that track while Phoebe sings about nepo baby privilege and the injustice of the music industry.

‘Love’ features one of the best moments throughout the album. Nearing the end, the guitars suddenly become muffled and muted, Phoebe’s singing receiving further emphasis as she sings she’s ‘so sorry for letting you down.’ Suddenly the guitars come back in, louder than before as they thunder through the final moments. This sudden juxtaposition makes the track so evoking and haunting; a beautiful moment of musicianship.

‘Big Dick Energy’ is another single released before the LP was. It’s perhaps one of the weakest on the record, for despite the engaging disrupted guitar that grabs your attention, the chorus feels quite repetitive. However, the verses and the bridge make up for this as the song talks about fake male allyship, used just as a cover to try and pick up women. The ‘nice guy’ facade is perfectly represented on this track and, as Phoebe sings, is ‘nothing but performative.’

Who Let The Dogs Out is a thoughtful, angry and completely engaging debut album that manages to capture the atmosphere and energy of the duo’s live performances all while discussing heavy topics carefully and with emotion. The songs are cathartic and, unfortunately, are often relatable but there is no pitying in these tracks – they are empowering anthems that aim to highlight social, everyday injustice while shifting the blame away from those affected. A strong debut from a group that is unapologetically themselves, Who Let The Dogs Out manages to offer comfort as well as a release.
