It has been 37 years since Deacon’s Blue’s debut album Raintown, and it’s clear that many fans have followed them loyally since.
<br>
At Margate’s Dreamland on Friday evening, the group performed their classic hits, as part of their current tour: All the Old 45s - the Best of Deacon Blue.
<br><br>
Opening with City of Love, frontman Ricky Ross ran through their most popular belters, taking the audience for a trip down memory lane.
<br><br>
Fergus Sings the Blues warmed up the set and afterwards the favourites came thick and fast.
<br><br>
Chocolate Girl had the crowd transforming into a karaoke act and looking around so many people had their eyes shut as they shouted out the chorus.
<br><br>
*“They could hear you in Clacton,”* said Ross, acknowledging the love for the song.
<br><br>
Then followed a rendition of Your Swaying Arms, with Ross singing to fellow vocalist Lorraine McIntosh, the song being especially poignant as they have been married for 34 years and have four children together.
<br><br>
Trying not to dampen the mood, Ross referred to the forthcoming election by saying “make sure you take your ID to vote,” raising a cheer.
<br><br>
When they debuted a new song, it was done with humour.
<br><br>
*“This is when I say four little words that send everyone to the bar,”* joked Ross.
<br><br>
*“Here's a new song.”*
<br><br>
Rollicking through the hits with the sun setting over Margate and the seagulls intent on dive bombing anyone foolish enough to be eating their food on the surrounding banks, Deacon Blue closed the show with Dignity and Wages Day, a sea of mobile phones recording the event for prosperity.
