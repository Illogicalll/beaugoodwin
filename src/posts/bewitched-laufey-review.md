*Bewitched* is Icelandic singer-songwriter Laufey’s second full-length LP. Following 2022’s *Everything I Know About Love*, *Bewitched* is a self-described album about love; platonic or romantic. With heavy inspiration from jazz artists, Laufey blends in beautifully with her idols with timeless tracks such as ‘From the Start’, ‘While You Were Sleeping’ and ‘Bewitched’.

Her range of vocals, being able to go from a low to high register with ease, enables these songs to truly convey the words and stories she has written about. There is intention behind every detail in the record with the tracks flowing seamlessly. These purposeful decisions allow the listener to be enthralled in the serene album and in the world of the music she has created.

*Bewitched* is a release that is fully realised, with the topic of love being examined and looked at through various angles. Laufey sings about unrequited love, heartbreak and falling in love itself. Songs like ‘Promise’ and ‘California and Me’ (which also feature the work of the Philharmonia Orchestra) showcase a side of love that Laufey hasn’t written about too much. They discuss the pain of one-sided love, of being deeply in love with someone while that person disregards your feelings. The swelling of sound underneath, with great help from the orchestra, helps to contrast the feelings talked about; of abounding adoration against someone who cares for someone else.

On songs like ‘From The Start’ and ‘Serendipity’, the story within the album returns to being in love and the feeling of realising you’re falling in love with them. Laufey doesn’t let Jazz be a genre she slots into, she uses Jazz as a way to push the narrative further. Every detail, every instrument and swell and note sung, they are all used as a vessel for her story and the meanings behind the song.

Even in the heartbreaking tracks, Laufey still allows for love to present. Love can be glorious and fulfilling but it can also be damning and painful - above all it is omnipresent and beautiful and to love is to experience the highs as well as the lows and allow yourself to be open to all of those moments. *Bewitched* is a love letter to loving and this journey and it is by using Jazz and the beauty of the instruments and her voice that she is able to make that point; often times the instruments grounding the listener and prevent them from being swept away in Laufey’s mesmerising voice.
