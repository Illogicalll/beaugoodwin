Dreamland Margate had another legendary band grace it’s stage last night with English rock band Elbow. Formed in the late 90’s, with their debut album being released in 2001, Elbow have had a phenomenal career with 10 studio albums, taking part in the London Olympics ceremony and also winning a Mercury Prize and Brit award. Their accolades continue with four of their records reaching number one in the charts as well as having four Top 20 singles.

  

They have recently released their 10th studio album ‘Audio Vertigo’ on the 22nd March and was also the first band to headline the Co-op arena in Manchester.

  

Their show in Margate was both the start to their summer tour for ‘Audio Vertigo’ as well as the first artist to kick off the summer season at Dreamland vintage fairground and open-air venue. Other artists such as Suede and Rudimental will also grace the Scenic Stage, as part of Margate’s Summer Series for music.

  

They were supported solo artist Isaac Gracie and by four piece band The Magic Numbers. The two acts helped to warm up the audience and get them ready for Elbow, demonstrating a comfortability on stage as well as exciting songs within their own right.

  

Across 19 songs, Elbow wow’ed Margate with a healthy mix of fan favourites and ‘classics’ as well as some deeper cuts across their various albums. Playing during the summer evening by the seaside, singer Guy Garvey stunning with powerful vocals.

  

They kicked the performance off early at 8:30 with a track from the recent LP, but the recency of the record does not dull the crowd as they sing along, excited for the iconic rock band’s set. There is a consistent energy throughout the show, with all of the members of the band delivering a devoted and passionate performance.

  

Hits like ‘Grounds for Divorce’ and ‘One Day Like This’, taken from their fourth record ‘The Seldom Seen Kid’, were particular fan favourite and received the loudest response from the crowd when they were played live. The theme of sing-alongs shined brightest with these two hits, with Guy splitting the Summer Scenic stage into two halves to sing various harmonies.

  

Pointing at the attendees when it was their turn to sing, he turned the people watching into his own personal choir, further adding to the positive and energetic atmosphere that Elbow had created.

  

There was an eclectic amount of songs played live, however, with the band not overwhelming the audience with deep cuts nor were they simply playing their greatest hits either. Songs like ‘Good Blood Mexico City’ and ‘Fly Boy Blue / Lunette’ were specific highlights of the show, bringing the crowd along through fast and heavy guitar riffs from Mark Potter, impassioned singing and thumping bass from Pete Turner. New band member Alex Reeves played the drums throughout the set, shining on extended endings to songs like ‘Dexter and Sinister’.

  

The band also took time to enjoy the late summer evening, the clear blue sky providing a picturesque backdrop for the band as they slowed the performances down for songs like ‘Puncture Repair’ and ballads like ‘Lippy Kids’. Both showcasing the talent of keyboard player Craig Potter, with Guy dedicating ‘Lippy Kids’ to “two beautiful children” in the front row. ‘Puncture Repair’ stripped the show down to just the keyboard and Guy, creating an intimate atmosphere that brought the spectators in even closer.

  

To add to their performances on tour, the band have also enlisted the aid of trumpets and backing vocalists. The addition of three extra members has the potential to overwhelm the crowd but they are used sparingly, and when used the trumpets and extra backing vocals push the songs to new heights live; giving them all an anthem edge.

  

Their showmanship shines with the crowd interactions of lead singer Guy. From referring to Margate only as ‘Margaret’ for the whole show to joking with the audience during brief breaks between songs. Before ‘Puncture Repair’, Craig on the keyboards stated how he hadn’t practiced this one before, causing Guy to state that fittingly for their surroundings, their performance was “quite like a high wire act” and he encouraged the audience to “picture Craig in tights”.

  

This wasn’t a singular incident either. These small moments of interaction with the mass of people were consistent throughout the show, Guy stating early how this show was “truly lovely” as well as complimenting their “beautiful” singing when called upon. Moments of banter repeated as well, with Guy joking how only one member of the audience “asked if we were okay” out of the roughly “4 and a bit thousand of you”.

  

There were a lot of mentions to the sea and the seaside as well. Before the encore, Guy joked that they wouldn’t come back, not “even if you do a rendition of ‘I do like to be beside the seaside.’”

  

Before ‘The Picture”, Guy discussed the idea of the body being given to the sea and turned to corruption, calling it poetic before stating how he fancied the “drama” of being “buried at sea”. Fitting with the seagulls and the sound of the waves behind them.

  

With the show closing out, the band giving their all for the biggest hit so far ‘One Day Like This’, Guy passionately asked the audience “Is this our Dreamland?” A question to linger on the mind of the people in attendance, Elbow kickstarted the summer series as well as their own tour with a bang, permanently leaving their mark on our Dreamland.
