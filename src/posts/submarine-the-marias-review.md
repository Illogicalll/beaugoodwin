The Marías’ second album, _Submarine_, was released May 31st 2024 with the band further exploring the dreamy-pop sound as well as shifting from the red colour palette of _Cinema_ to a deep blue, matching the title in following an aquatic theme. The record itself is seeped in the personal with lyrics that dissect the end of the relationship between the founding members of the band María Zardoya and Josh Conway; with María Zardoya being the lead vocalist of the group.

  

The band have built up a name for themselves with their creative blend of both English and Spanish vocals as well as a dream-pop sound with heavy jazz influences. María has stated that the band started with them creating music for films and that is very much apparent in their two discography that are extremely atmospheric with a strong narrative and thematic thread.

  

As a whole, the sophomore album dives deep into the end of a relationship. _Submarine_ tackles the slow descent and drifting apart of the two partners, questioning where it went wrong, how it could’ve been saved and also what more could’ve been. The end of a relationship is based on the experience of the breakup between Josh Conway and María, at a time where María didn’t know if the band would even continue.

  

We can see these subjects almost instantly. On the third track off the album, ‘Echo’, María sings about the initial aftermath of a breakup, the drama of it. There’s the loss of control as you suddenly break away from someone, referenced with the line: “‘Cause we both know that this situation’s out of control, Now I’m caught in the middle, Breaking down on the floor.” It flitters between a subdued, lounge room vibe during the verses to a more energetic chorus with the drums coming in as well as the guitar and synth having more of an effect.

  

This constant change between subdued, slow jazz verses and powerful, loud choruses are a constant through the LP. The atmosphere works perfectly for the record, giving it that submerged under water vibe that is initially evoked with the title. During most of the songs, especially with the use of instrumentals during the openings or verses, you can feel the bass thud while being muted, the guitars sounding quieter as well as if they’re being palm muted, as if you’re hearing the music being played while you’re swimming under the water.

  

‘Run Your Mouth’ was the first single to be released, written shortly after the breakup. It’s one of the faster songs on the LP,  working well to fuel the more angry, loud and emotional side of the breakup narrative compared to the slower, more sadder and introspective ballads. These songs include ‘No One Noticed’ and ‘If Only’, which were the joint last singles to be released. ‘No One Noticed’ is a shining example of The Marías at their creative peak. The highlight of this track is the constant back and forth María creates with her vocals, using the backing vocals as a way to create this contrast/see-saw effect, much like a conversation.

  

The Marías also include songs written in Spanish, with María’s latin-vocals call out for her lover on the track ‘Lejos De Ti’, the power increasing as it progresses, the question becoming more demanding. The other non-English track is ‘Ay No Peudo’, with María describing this song as bittersweet at the listening party, due to the title meaning that the love is so immense that she can’t contain it inside her or that the pain is too much to handle.

  

‘If Only’ feels like a James Bond theme as it leads with a gorgeous and simple piano riff and remains ultimately very simple, keeping barebones with the exception of a beautiful trumpet interlude to ensure focus is on María, with María yearning for her ex-lover, cursing herself for leaving and questioning her decision, pleading with him to not “give up on me” as she fears, and reconciles herself to the fact, that she will “only see you in my dreams”. While it’s a dreamy song sonically, invoking the idea of floating on clouds as you drift through on María’s voice and vocal delivery, it’s ultimately heartbreaking and serves as a perfect segue into the final track, ‘Sienna’.

  

‘Sienna’, the last track on the 14-song album, is all about what could’ve been. With the title taken from the name for a possible daughter, the lyrics revolves around the fantasy of what the future could’ve held and how it lives on as just a fantasy. It follows the simple and repeated structure for their songs, with the verses building atmosphere before the choruses bring up the energy, bass leading the track. The use of synth backs María’s introductory vocals, like usual, with the guitar sweeping in alongside the drums to provide that dreamy, jazz-influenced sound and rhythm. It’s the perfect example of the contrast between how the song sounds versus the meaning, with the funkiness actually harbouring a more heartbreaking meaning. “Sienna would look just like you”, “I live under your eyelids, I’ll always be yours”, “And I smile when I think of all the times we had,” and more of a perfect example also being in the short bridge María writes where she lists how this fictional, hypothetical, Sienna would’ve been similar to her ex-lover. Building and building, the song is about to climax into what feels like an explosion of sounds; drums and guitar chords combining, but as María sings about Sienna disappearing in her mind, almost instantly the sounds disappear too, leaving a short 15 second vacuum of sound - a perfect metaphor for the relationship as the viewers are left without this explosion and cathartic climax, just like how María is left without her Sienna.

  

Ultimately, the second studio album from The Marías doesn’t change too much sonically from their first output _Cinema_. _Submarine_ is still heavily embedded in the dream/indie-pop sound, with jazz and Spanish/Puerto Rican elements and influences threaded throughout every song and every style choice. But that’s not a bad thing. What The Marías did with _Submarine_ was improve on that sound and genre, mastering the synth and atmosphere and utilising sound, especially the lack of sound, to create space in each moment of the LP. It is a confident release that manages to balance the heavily emotional topics alongside the dreamy and funky instrumentals that make the songs so fun to listen to. This balance was important, and in many moments extremely necessary, with care and delicacy in every decision made throughout the recording process and that effort is not unappreciated. With the intricate instrumentals alongside the dream-like, soulful singing and emotive lyrics all about relationships and break-ups, _Submarine_ explores the loss of love and the possibility of what could’ve been had the relationship not failed; all while remaining playful and expanding on the jazz and lounge influences, pushing the boundary of dream-pop.
