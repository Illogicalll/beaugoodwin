Following the release of their sixth studio album Pick-Up Full of Pink Carnations, indie-rock heavyweights The Vaccines have embarked on an expansive UK and Europe tour.

Leas Cliff Hall in Folkestone was the latest stop for the band after their recent show at Dreamland in Margate, featuring songs from the recent Top 10 album as well as old favourites such as If You Wanna and All My Friends Are Falling In Love.

#### The Vaccines stopped off at Leas Cliff Hall in Folkestone as part of their intimate UK tour

Support for the tour, Divorce and Teen Jesus and the Jean Teasers, complemented the headliners perfectly, setting the tone for the main show with uniqueness and individuality.

Songs such as Sex and The Millenium Bridge by Divorce and AHHHH! by Teen Jesus illustrated the balance between being a good warm-up for the crowd and being worthy of their time on the stage.

Divorce, who released their second EP Heady Metal in November last year, showcased vulnerability in their songs, with relatable, provoking lyricism and intricate, country-style guitar riffs that transitioned with ease into distorted power chords.

#### Support band Divorce warming up the crowd

Aussie band Teen Jesus released their debut album I Love You last October, with cathartic rock songs and slower ballads. Their presence on stage is full of passion, with the members of both bands giving their all and energising the crowd.

After Teen Jesus left the stage, the crowd were left yearning for when the support bands would return as headliners in their own right.

#### The indie band kept the energy high throughout their 20-song set

The Vaccines then took to the stage and, during their stellar 20-song set, they cruised through varying topics, all brought together by the consistent thread of the indie-rock sound.

Despite this constant in sound, there is no fear of repetition. The group weaved more emotive songs with faster crowd pleasers (like Post Break-Up Sex into Wetsuit, both from the same album but with a difference in tone and tempo).

The Vaccines engaged the audience throughout the entirety of their set, not once wasting time or attention. This wasn’t down to just the setlist, but also the presence they brought on stage.

#### The band are known for hits such as If You Wanna, Teenage Icon and I Always Knew

This energy first gained them publicity in the early half of the 2010s and it’s an energy that is necessary for an indie-rock sound. It helped start the show off instantly with the fast-paced Love to Walk Away before quickly launching into Wreckin’ Bar (Ra Ra Ra).

This ferociousness in performance elevated the songs from their album versions. Played live, they elicited a huge reaction, encouraging the audience to sing or dance along while the band tore through the chords, the lyrics, and the show.

#### The Vaccines frontman Justin Young

The specialness of bands playing a town like Folkestone was not unnoticed.

Through Divorce’s set, they remarked how this was their first time playing Folkestone, usually they would “drive through … for the Eurotunnel”.

The Vaccines also picked up on this and, when they did give themselves a minute to breathe, lead singer Justin Young rooted himself centre stage with the mic and asked the crowd “Is this Folkestone? I thought it was France…”.

#### The seaside venue has a capacity of around 1,500

Halfway through the show, Justin surprised the audience by announcing they were playing an unusual song, a request from the show prior at Margate.

Wielding an acoustic guitar, the band delivered a stunning rendition of Sunkissed from their newest LP.

#### The London-based band first rose to fame with the release of their debut album, What Did You Expect from the Vaccines, in 2011

The Vaccines, even over 10 years and five albums in, do not falter in quality.

Instead, they have focused on progressing their sound, remaining closely tied to the indie rock they cut their teeth with while also introducing new perspectives and experimenting with new ways to write, creating records that deliver the same euphoria (especially live) while also pushing new boundaries.

Their show in Folkestone, for such a legendary band of the genre, was triumphant and will forever be remembered, not just for the intimate venue but for the consistent quality of the headline and their supports.
