Following the release of their 6th studio album *Pick-Up Full of Pink Carnations*, indie-rock heavyweights The Vaccines have embarked on an expansive UK and Europe tour. Leas Cliff Hall in Folkestone was the latest stop for the band after their show at Dreamland in Margate, featuring them showing off many songs from the recent top-10 charting album as well as revisiting old favourites such as ‘If You Wanna’ and ‘All My Friends Are Falling In Love’. 
<br>
Through a 20-song set, the Vaccines cruised through varying topics, all brought together by the consistent thread of the indie-rock sound. This constant in sound does not prohibit exploration or create dull moments. There is no fear of repetition, the group weaving slower and more emotive songs in the set with the faster, crowd pleasers (like ‘Post Break-Up Sex’ into ‘Wetsuit', both from the same album but both displaying a difference in tone and tempo).
<br><br>
The support for the tour, ‘Divorce’ and ‘Teen Jesus and the Jean Teasers’ complement the headliners perfectly. Setting the tone for the main show they also displayed uniqueness and individuality with their sound, proving their right to be the support for the iconic British band.
<br><br>
Songs such as ‘Sex & The Millenium Bridge’ by Divorce and ‘AHHHH!’ by Teen Jesus illustrate that ability, the balance between being just a good warm-up for the crowd but also worthy of the presence and time on the stage. After Teen Jesus left the stage, the venue was left yearning for when the support bands, Divorce and Teen Jesus and the Jean Teasers, would return as headliners in their own right.
<br><br>
Divorce, who released their second EP ‘Heady Metal’ in November last year, showcased vulnerability in their songs, with relatable, provoking lyricism that is complemented by intricate, country-style guitar riffs that transition with ease into distorted power chords, creating an interesting but brilliantly executed blend in style. Aussie band ‘Teen Jesus’ released their debut album ‘I Love You’ last October. With a dynamic of cathartic rock songs with more slower and vulnerable ballads, the support set reflects this balance, ‘Treat Me Better’ flowing from a muted and calmer, yet still rhythmic, verses to a rockier, power chord vibe. Their presence on stage is full of passion, with the members of both bands giving their all and energising the crowd with their powerful songs.
<br><br>
The Vaccines engage the audience throughout the entirety of their set, never once wasting time or attention. This is not due to just the setlist placement, but also the presence they bring on stage-an energy that first gained them publicity in the early half of the 2010s; an energy that is necessary for an indie-rock sound and an energy that starts the show off instantly with the fast-paced “Love to Walk Away”. A second is not wasted at all, they quickly go into the next song with fervour “Wreckin’ Bar (Ra Ra Ra)”, giving the fans their entire attention and energy. 
<br><br>
This ferociousness in performance elevates the songs from the album version. Played live, they elicit a reaction, encouraging the audience to sing or dance along while the band tears through the chords, the lyrics, and the show. 
<br><br>
The specialness of bands playing Folkestone was not unnoticed. Through Divorce’s set, they remarked how this is their first time playing Folkestone, usually they would “Drive through …for the Eurotunnel”. The Vaccines also picked up on this and when they did give themselves a minute to breathe after the third song, lead singer Justin Young rooted himself centre stage with the mic and asked the crowd “Is this Folkestone? I thought it was France…”
<br><br>
Halfway through the show, Justin surprised the audience by announcing they were playing an unusual song, a request from the show prior at Margate. Wielding an acoustic guitar, the band delivered a stunning rendition of ‘Sunkissed’ from their newest LP. 
<br><br>
The Vaccines, even over 10 years and 5 albums in, do not falter in quality. Instead, the time they have has been refocused on progressing their sound, remaining closely tied to the indie rock they cut their teeth on while also introducing new perspectives and experimenting with new ways to write, creating records that deliver the same euphoria (especially live) while also pushing new boundaries. Their show in Folkestone, for such a legendary indie band, was triumphant and will forever be remembered, not just for playing such a venue from such a tenured band but for the consistent quality of the headline and their support.
