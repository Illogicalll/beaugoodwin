Jonah Yano returns with Jonah Yano & The Heavy Loop, an extremely ambitious album that innovates alternative jazz. With 8 songs, the runtime pushes close to the hour mark, mainly due to the final track ‘The Heavy Loop’, a 30-minute improv piece that feels more like an “idea than a song.”

A lot of the album focuses on relationships with the connections between people being explored and mined throughout the record. On ‘The Heavy Loop’, the focus is on the connection between the band and the musicians, the idea being that it is always happening even when not being performed because they are all in the band. On ‘Romance ESL’, Jonah writes a love song where he explores how English is his second language and uses that repeated experience in romantic relationships to guide the song – “This is romance in a second language.” On ‘Snowpath’, a collaboration with Clairo, the duo uses their environment of being out in a snowed-in studio in Canada to explore their friendly relationship and how the steps taken in snow will be the same ones that the others will take, exploring that trust and the physical evidence of that trust that is contained in the snow itself.

The record is deeply personal. Not only does he explore connections within relationships but also connections to cities and places, or the lack thereof. This can be heard most clearly on ‘Someone Asked Me How I’ve Been’, where he uses it as a way to talk about the loneliness when in a new city (for Jonah this was Japan). The balance of being personal while also being relatable is heard throughout the whole record and never once teeters closer to one side than the other – Jonah consistently manages to maintain that delicate balance. As such, it enables the song to be that much more emotional and intimate, the listener feeling privileged and special to be hearing the art because of this constant and calculated delicacy to the singing, the lyrics and the instruments. Everything is deliberate and even during the improv piece, there is restraint from overindulging – every process is carefully considered.

There is tenderness throughout. Most noticeably I found the track ‘The Language of Coincidence’ to be especially touching. The piano and saxophone shine brightly as Jonah sings “There’s a world in your eyes.” It’s a slower pace, and even when it picks up it doesn’t quicken too dramatically, remaining quite constant. ‘No Petty Magic’ is also equally as tender and as beautiful. Featuring co-vocals from Helena Deland (who also has writing credits) as well as the cello and harp being played by Ouri, it feels lush and delicate. You glide through each second as if on a cloud, the lyrics poetic and lovely with lines such as “Can you still feel the shape of my hand in your hand?”

Tenderness isn’t just found in the quieter, slower moments of the album though. They can also be found in the more chaotic and fun moments – notably in ‘Romance ESL’, where the song gets louder and feels almost like metals clanging together and a wall of noise is being formed. It’s a feat that Jonah and his band manage to pull off such a sound and avoid it sounding too loud and unorganised and as it closes out, Jonah singing the last line “This is romance in a second language” repeatedly over Chris Edmondson’s outstanding saxophone, it feels even more compelling and provoking – standing out amidst an incredible tracklist.

‘Snowpath’ provides the listener with a calmer experience after ‘Romance ESL’. It’s the most stripped-back song on the album, featuring a singular guitar by Jonah and vocal performances from both him and Clairo, the contrast to the previous song is night and day yet not once does it feel out of place.

[Clairo](https://northerntransmissions.com/clairo-charm/)  has been on top form recently, with Charm having been an incredible record, and her vocals on ‘Snowpath’ are perfect, fitting right into the whispered tones and dreamy atmosphere.

The biggest risk taken on the album comes at the very end. After the 7th track, ‘Someone Asked Me How I’ve Been’, Jonah and his band embark on the final track ‘The Heavy Loop’ and in doing so spend 30 minutes playing an improvised jazz piece. Described by Jonah as the ‘centrepiece of the record’, the song is a direct response to an animated video by Nik Arthur, projected onto the wall while the band “build the arc of our improvisation around the video itself.” While the run time is intimidating, the effort that’s gone into it shows with each minute. They create a beautiful and touching piece about the relationship between them, with there being moments as the instruments swell and build before retreating into the quieter and slower ambience. There’s no rush and the time taken pays off, allowing for each aspect of the song to be developed properly and create an intimate environment for the listener.

Extremely ambitious, Jonah Yano & The Heavy Loop is a touching, intimate and powerful album that stays with you constantly. It feels endless, every listen feeling refreshing and new, and the care and love put into it is clear early on. The record demands your attention, and in giving it, it will give something back to you. A beautiful record that progresses from Jonah’s previous two while also being innovative. Jonah Yano & The Heavy Loop stands out as one of the best albums released this year.
