Daisy the Great’s newest EP _Spectacle: Daisy the Great vs. Tony Visconti_ is their best work yet. Working with legendary producer Tony Visconti ([David Bowie](https://northerntransmissions.com/blackstar-by-david-bowie/), T. Rex) is certain to produce amazing music but DtG, a collaboration between Kelley Dugan and Mina Walker, manage to ensure that the five tracks have their own unique, special twist.

The greatest strength of DtG are the two members, Kelley and Mina, and they recognise this and channel it by creating beautiful harmonies. These range from singing similarly over one another, like in ‘All The People’ and ‘Butterfly, Stay Dry’, and contrasting vocals where one sings in a lower-pitch, utilising more of a spoken-word approach which is contrasted by the other singing the melody “I wanted to go slowly”; heard on the track ‘Pretty Painting’.

‘All The People’ opens the project and instantly sets the tone for the EP. Warm, melodic singing is backed by interesting instrumental choices that help guide the song. It feels welcoming and instantly it’s hard to not feel invested, the lyrics being poetic about time and how the constant ticking away of time is enthused in everyday life. ‘Butterfly, Stay Dry’ continues similarly but utilises a flute solo at the end, reinforcing the warm, summery and nature-esque vibe that the band are going for. ‘Pretty Painting’ is one of the stronger tracks on an extremely strong extended project. You’re drawn in by the contrasting vocal styles and nearer the end, the backing vocals feel almost like they’re screaming. This elevates the song even higher, making it even more emotive. The writing is longing and heartfelt, some of the best yet, with lines such as “Do they know it’s obvious they painted in your shade?” aiding the narrative element of the romantic song.

The harmonic vocal style is backed by poetic and provoking songwriting as well as lush, 70s glam-inspired instrumentals. The penultimate song ‘Spectacle’ features beautiful writing such as: “Look at me and tell me straight. Have I become a replica?” And “Make me amazing by saying it twice.” The sing-talking effect makes the lyrics and vocals feel even more powerful, as the voice feels doubled and that much fuller. The whole track is a lot punkier than the rest of the EP, the slower pace helping to an overall enjoyable and well-thought-out pace for the project.

‘Fireman!’ is another standout track. The lyrics feel even more catchy and playful than before, opening the song with a bouncy rhythm that instantly works its way into your ear: “Half an hour from a subway station I had a revelation, my feet are stuck in my shoes and someone glued my shoes to the sidewalk.” While playful, the lyrics do not sacrifice emotional impact, with writing such as “I’m like an angel in plaster, come on let me fly up close to the sun,” being one of the many lines that continue in the playful and funky sound while also being poetic and personal. The vocals change in the later half, with one half of the group while the other takes a step away from the mic and shouts the words slower, creating this effect like they’re in an empty hall – an amazing contrast that highlights the ultimately melancholic aspect.

Ultimately, _Spectacle: Daisy the Great vs. Tony Visconti_ is a compelling and emotive EP that delicately juggles playful melodies and writing with serious and thought-provoking topics. The addition of Visconti enables new heights to be reached, with the melodies feeling full amidst the curated chaos of the instruments without any part feeling lost or overwhelming – everything is mixed perfectly and clearly. Each decision from the band feels carefully thought out and precise and the listener can hear that in every second. It is hard to find fault in the release, with the greatest problem I had being that I wanted it to never stop.
