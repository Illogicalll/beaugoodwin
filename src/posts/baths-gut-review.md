**Gut, the hotly anticipated album from Baths, delivers on its title promise. Written from the stomach instead of the heart, Baths – real name  [Will Wiesenfeld](https://northerntransmissions.com/pendant-to-release-caustic-pop-remixes/)  – wanted to bare himself fully and write about his honest, unfiltered thoughts. In doing so, we encounter repeated themes of sex, relationships and yearning.**

The nature of these topics can often be uncomfortable but Wiesenfeld, in tackling them head-on, treats them so matter-of-fact and commonplace that they feel natural. There are few metaphors used to describe these thoughts and ideas in the songs, putting it wonderfully in the song ‘Peacocking’: “Why be subtle when I’m with you?” Despite this lack of subtlety, the writing is often poetic, as seen in the lines “Peace among us lost and softer equals.” (Verity) and “I make a great show of sincerity, I fuck without honesty.” There’s a simplicity to it but it’s in the everyday observation of his writing where we can extract the most impact and meaning.

The instrumentation of the LP is lush and complex. There’s a wide range of instruments, all used to their full advantage. The drums shine the most on the faster, frantic tunes like ‘Eyewall’ and ‘Sea of Men’ while the use of string instruments (violins, cello and viola) shine the most on the slower, more laid-back songs like ‘Governed’, ‘Homosexuals’ and ‘The Sound of a Blossoming Flower’. Weisenfeld likes to build anticipation in the work as well, with energy building and bubbling in the background before finally being released to cathartic joy – seen the best in ‘American Mytbos’.

The highlights of the project are in the songs ‘Eden’, ‘Cedar Stairwell’ and ‘The Sound of a Blossoming Flower’. These represent Baths at its peak, with personal, vulnerable writing and compelling instrumentation that drive the songs forward. The Biblical lyricism in ‘Eden’, with Weisenfeld singing “Baby you come down, Eden’s what you make of me.”, elevates the electronic sound. It feels lush and quite dreamy and intrigues the listener, aided by the use of strings. The final chorus includes all instruments that had been introduced, pushing the song into a climactic ending as it urges you to dance along with the rhythmic beats.

‘Cedar Stairwell’ is much more personal and slower – reflected in the vocals and sound. The lyrics are emotive as they touch on the idea of forbidden romance, evoking an intimate atmosphere while doing so. The closing track similarly starts off slowly, with bird sounds and a piano progression that backs elegant vocals. It’s ethereal with the strings beginning to swell before the energy changes halfway through, the tempo quickening frantically with drums now leading the charge – ultimately ensuring that the album ends on a dancing, rhythmic height.

Baths’ fourth project Gut is a brutally honest and direct record. The intent was ambitious but with rich instrumentation that continually adds depth to the songs and an intriguing contrast between the intimate ballads and the more energetic tracks that urge you to dance, the album ensures an enjoyable and intriguing listen that will undoubtedly cause it to be revisited.
