**Hundred Reasons return after an absence of 15 years with their fifth studio album ‘Glorious Sunset’- a rejuvenation of the band that is reminiscent of their debut record, and the sounds of early 2000’s British Rock.**

Spread out across 10 tracks, the group showcases their artistry with songs that mix their original, emo-influenced sound with rock influences to create a more mature record.

Guitar and vocals take centre stage here with Colin Doran (lead vocals) and Larry Hibbitt (lead guitar) shining on this record. Doran’s distinctive voice creates a powerful, thumping and almost anthemic edge that helps give the songs meaning and a story. The delivery is very similar of the early British and American punk and rock scene.

Hibbitt’s playing is without a doubt the highlight of the album. While some songs like ‘It Suits You’ and ‘Done’ take influence from heavy rock other tracks like ‘Replicate’ and ‘Wave Form’ use more of a poignant and slower approach with the focus on the build-up to create an almost cathartic explosion of sound for the climax. A particular track that showcases his skill is ‘Done’ with the moody tone of the guitar creating an atmosphere in the song that places it above others.

Focus cannot be taken away from Andy Gilmour’s bass playing however as he provides a fundamental role in not only creating the atmosphere but in also giving these songs a stadium-rock edge. ‘Right There With You’ is a prime example of his ability to give these songs that edge with Andy Bews’ drums also helping make the song more unique and energetic.

The album as a whole is concise and fluid between each song. It is clear that the members did this out of pure creative interest and joy and this can be reflected throughout. The sound of their debut and the backdrop of American Punk-Rock and 2000s British Rock that the band was born out of can be heard but it is fleeting as they reveal a more complex sound. They use a variety in guitar styles to create depth contrast between each song. Hundred Reasons prove that whilst it has been 15 year since they last released an LP, they have not lost their talent or their love for creating music. ‘Glorious Sunset’ delivers a long-awaited record that will delight long time fans of the group and bring in a whole new generation of listeners.
