_Charm_, Clairo’s third studio album, brings the listener into a world of romantic connections, warm bass and emotive singing that explores the space between people. Clairo, real name Claire Cottrill, took a break after releasing her sophomore record _Sling_ in 2021. She took this time to discover her voice and her style, taking pleasure in being alone in her house in upstate New York. _Sling_ questioned her purpose in the music industry, debating her future as well as contemplating a more domestic life. With _Charm_, these questions have been answered and processed, Clairo in return being more empowered, more confident, taking control of her sexuality and explores love while enlisting the help of Leon Michels from Big Crown Records and El Michels Affair fame.

  

The title came from Claire’s fascination with the word and what happens when someone is charmed or being charming, how it builds off of what you don’t know about the other to create these hopeful ideals about them. Love, more specifically the connection between people, is explored throughout the album as main theme.

  

There is a progression in Claire’s sound. It’s more confident, more emotive and showcases Claire’s eclectic taste in music. _Charm_ is like a combination of her recent NTS radio sessions, from obscure 45s that are funky/soulful to her deep love of Harry Nilsson, _Charm_ is a project that fuses all of these passions and tastes into one.

  

There is a playfulness throughout the LP, keeping it light and fun. On the lead single Sexy to Someone, Claire states about how being sexy is important to her as it would give her a “reason to get out of the house”. On Second Nature she sings about the overwhelming effect the early stages of love has with lyrics like “My train of thought destroyed … And once you get in my ear, I see kismet sinking in,”. As the song nears its end we can hear Claire start laughing in the background, another example of the playfulness of the record.

  

Laughter is brought up again later in the album. In Add Up My Love, one of the most upbeat and catchiest songs from the record, Claire sings about her former lover missing her laugh: “Do you miss my laugh? Hear it from the back of the room, it’s just something I miss too,” This contrast from the mourning of laughter with a loved one after hearing her laugh in Second Nature displays the constant see-saw effect of desire and the positives/negatives of uncertain romantic connection.

  

While the album remains groovy, retaining the constant 70s inspiration, it doesn’t shy away from heavy topics. On the opening track Nomad, Claire sings about selling and giving up everything, becoming “nomadic”, ultimately giving up everything for an unreciprocated lover. On Thank You, the song tackles the awareness of a doomed relationship. Singing “We don’t get on, can’t make you laugh, personality” as reasons for the failure, she goes on to say in the chorus how she would “thank you for your time”. The piano hook on the chorus turns the otherwise saddening topic into a catchy ear worm, designed to stay in one’s head for a while after hearing the song.

  

Echo and Terrapin take on a more sparse sound, utilising space and emptiness in recordings to flesh out the song. In turn, these songs feel more lived in, with the space providing a sense of time that the song has been lived in. Echo evokes the best from 60s French love songs, utilising the organ to its fullest capability while Terrapin has a dreamy atmosphere with sparse drum fills and a beautiful piano lead, often being allowed to move away from a structured rhythm with sophisticated yet quick fills. Slow Dance also utilises piano as the main instrument. Claire’s voice takes a lead on this song too, opening with “Da-dum, da-dum,” and featuring layered vocals in the chorus that allows the song to feel like it’s ascending to heaven.

  

Juna is one of the standout tracks on an already standout record. With one of the best bridges in Clairo’s discography, the playfulness of desire and intimacy is shown with lines such as “You make me wanna go buy a new dress, you make me wanna slip off a new dress.” It is a hypnotic bridge, followed with a repeat of the chorus where she says about how well her lover knows her and how that has informed these feelings: “With you, there’s no pretending. You know me.”

  

In Glory of the Snow, we hear Claire and producer Leon Michels craft an upbeat song that builds and builds. There’s a back and forth between the instruments and the vocals, with the piano coming in when the vocals retract. In the breaks after the chorus, we are treated to a flute which aids the nature, upstate New York atmosphere crafted throughout the song/album.

  

The album ends with the most emotive closing track on the record. Pier 4 is serious, without a doubt the saddest song on the LP, stripping back to effectively just an acoustic guitar and her voice; other instruments quietly building, sweeping in through the song such as a flute, clarinet and an organ. It is an excellent way to end the record, the acoustic track ensuring all attention is placed on Claire and the lyrics, with their being comfort in the intimate recording. You are made to feel like you’re there with her, especially when the backing vocals are introduced and the layered singing feels like it is engulfing you.

  

_Charm_ is a thoughtful, passionate project with Leon Michels as a producer and collaborator being a perfect choice for such an album, adding so much to the sound and vibe of all the songs. The themes of love, connections and the ambiguity of a developing romance is explored through beautiful songwriting with Claire’s years as a musician is shown in the mature, carefully thought out arrangements of every instrument and layering of every vocal recording. _Charm_ enters into Clairo’s discography not just as a phenomenal album, a context of her life and her own musical tastes, but as her magnum opus thus far.
