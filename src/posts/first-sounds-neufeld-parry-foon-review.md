First Sounds is the newest neoclassical from Montreal artists Sarah Neufeld, Richard Reed Parry and Rebecca Foon; playing violin, multiple instruments and cello respectively. Their past work is impressive, with Sarah and Richard being members of Arcade Fire and Rebecca from Set Fire to Flames, and at a glance there is the threat of their past work overshadowing this record. However, this project is totally unique and singular. It exists because of the collaboration between the three, uninformed by prior work.

Across nine songs, with many ranging from 6-11 minutes, the trio explore the changes in their lives through their instruments, letting their past art influence them. The album is extremely atmospheric, instantly conjuring up powerful images of open spaces covered in mist or anxiety-inducing, fast-paced panic attacks.

Due to the nature of the album, and how atmospheric it is from the start, the listener is invited to insert themselves into the setting. The neoclassical genre, void of any lyricism or singing, adds a new dimension to the listening experience as people can add more relatability to the tracks, the songs being a canvas to the listener. Unlike the vast majority of other albums, a record like this is different due to that interactive element, feeling more collaborative and inviting rather than the usual experience of listening in to a finished project which can often not allow for the relatability of the fan to be so easily inserted.

The imagery that is conjured up oftentimes feels like it’s straight out of a fantasy, with fog sweeping over hills in the early morning. The trio’s talent with their instruments is pushed to the limit on these songs, with Foon’s cello playing shining on the last track ‘Georgia’, adding an eerie undertone that strikes deep in the heart, the slowness increasing that deeply soulful and slightly off-putting tone.

‘Clouding Clouds’ is also slow-paced. With the longest runtime on the LP at 11 minutes; it allows itself to take its time and expand on the sound. The atmosphere that is created is some of the most poignant and vivid on the record due to the freedoms the song has because of its length. It’s very stripped back and minimal with very few complex layers – everything works well together without overlapping. Whilst long, the length is justified with some of the most thoughtful instrumentation to be heard.

‘Duelling Flutters’ and ‘Circular’ create a more panicky and anxious feeling. The violin, played by  [Sarah Neufeld](https://northerntransmissions.com/sarah-neufeld-releases-new-single-detritus/), shines on these two specifically with the scratchy and rapid violin playing being essential to setting the vibe that is then expanded on over the course of the song.

The entire album is consistent with this theme of melancholy-esque pensiveness. With the low notes from the cello,  [Richard Reed Parry](https://northerntransmissions.com/lost-in-the-waves-richard-reed-parry/)’s prowess across multiple instruments or the violin that is often at the forefront, every track feels ruminative and carefully measured. There is an entire world created, with rich and vivid imagery, and the narrative is open but at the very centre is the questioning of deeper thoughts and meanings. This topic is coaxed out with their instruments and by the end of the LP, it is hard not to feel spiritual or contemplative – it is a transformative experience. The melancholy, brought out by the slower and longer tracks, is not an obstruction to that experience but a catalyst, helping to place oneself into that thoughtful mindset.

First Sounds is a beautiful and ambitious project, an outlier in modern music, and totally seeped in human experience and emotion. It is delicate without being fragile and is enthralling throughout, leading to a thoughtful and emotive listening experience.
