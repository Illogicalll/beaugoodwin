----------



**Revengeseekerz, Jane Remover’s third album, came as a surprise when it dropped just a few months after Ghostholding, which was released under the alias Venturing. Describing the sound of Revengeseekerz is a difficult task, with Jane Remover experimenting with aspects of different genres that result in a melting pot of influences and outcomes. But the overall mood of the record remains the same, being similar to that of contemporaries Bladee or Playboi Carti.**

There are 12 tracks on the LP, resulting in a run time of 49 minutes. Throughout, there are often glimpses of great moments; however, the fatal flaw of the project is this length. The songs lean into rage music, with heavy use of autotune in order to achieve the specific style desired and the electronic genre is accompanied by synths and trap beats, a constant flurry of sound that crashes all around the listeners. It’s dizzying and overwhelming – there are times it can immediately immerse the listener and times when it becomes simply too much and, in doing so, can alienate the listener from the track, such as in the songs ‘Professional Vengeance’ and ‘TURN UP OR DIE’.

‘Star people’ and ‘Dreamflasher’ are songs that work to immerse the listener. It’s disorientating, but Jane Remover remains in control, steering us through the elastic drums and bass that thunder throughout. ‘Dreamflasher’ features some of the best writing on the record. “A thousand people scream my fucking name, it don’t mean shit if I don’t hear you say it,” and “Baby, tell me what’s the point of preaching to the choir if I can’t see you in the crowd?” It is vulnerable and romantic, mixed in with the energetic and unique production to create an interesting contrast and highlight the song overall.

‘Dancing with your eyes closed’ stands out as one of the more frustrating moments on the album. Listening to it, there are flashes of catchy and compelling riffs or choruses, but it’s overshadowed by the electro/pop-punk instrumentation, which comes across as overly violent and uninteresting. It doesn’t work with the writing and sticks out amidst the project as a song that overindulges, Jane Remover losing themself in the production as it seems to lack an overall direction and purpose. There will be some unique production instances, a choice in the songwriting that sticks out but is quickly overshadowed by overly chaotic and incessant bass and electronic drums.

‘Psychoboost’ features  [Danny Brown](https://northerntransmissions.com/danny-brown-quaranta/)  and stands out as he fits effortlessly into the sonic landscape and style of the record. ‘Dark night castle’, the penultimate song, draws back away from the chaos and, in doing so, becomes more tender and vulnerable. This stripped-down approach is welcomed and allows it to explore the heart and soul of the record more, allowing the songwriting to truly shine.

Revengeseekerz is an album with heart, passion and purpose, but it can also rely too heavily on creating a chaotic wall of sound that overshadows any other aspect of the tracks. The songs can often become repetitive and fail to stand out, blending into one and running a risk of becoming forgetful and monotonous, not strong or unique enough to stand out as one.

However, there are flashes of brilliance, and some of these are followed through beautifully, such as in ‘Star people’ which features a surprising and interesting tone change halfway through that keeps the listener engaged and the LP sounding fresh and exciting. Jane Remover is easily a rising prodigy in modern-rap/rage music, but while this album sometimes fails to land the punch it so nearly delivers, it does display immense talent, something hopefully wielded to its full potential for the next record.
