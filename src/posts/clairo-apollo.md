For two nights, Clairo’s Charm tour takes over The Hammersmith Eventim Apollo in London, where she performs tracks from all of her released projects thus far. Across 21 songs, the crowd are treated to fan-favourites as well as deep cuts from her first EP and side-project.

  

The show focused on the songs from her third LP Charm, a beautiful and playful record exploring sexiness and attraction. Clairo, real name Claire Cottrill, brings these songs to life with the help of her backing band. Every member is on peak form and helps to create the atmosphere that allows the performance to truly succeed. The bass and drums shake the foundations of the venue, the keyboard/synth and wind instruments add a complexity to every track, emphasising certain cathartic moments for the audience, and the guitar is often subtle yet never wasted, shining the most on tracks from her debut LP Immunity.

  

The show kicks off with the first two songs from the newest record, setting the tone for the rest of the night, before the energy picks up with the bouncier ‘Thank You’, the London fans singing the chorus so loudly back that it threatens to drown out Claire’s voice. A similar moment happens during ‘Add Up My Love’ where the enthusiasm and excitement result in Claire’s microphone nearly being eclipsed - a sure sign of success in bringing the songs to life so faithfully. ‘Slow Dance’ and ‘Terrapin’ help ease the speed of the set at times, amidst the catalogue that is interspersed throughout her newer material, but the reduced tempo does not mean a drop in enthusiasm for the fans are as excited to hear the hauntingly heartfelt ‘Slow Dance’ or the romantic ‘Terrapin’ just as much as they are to hear any other track.

  

To fit the sound of the newer record, which is a departure from Immunity’s indie-pop or Sling’s folkier vibe, her older work has been revisited and updated. This is most notable in the three tracks played from Sling, a Joni Mitchell-influenced record that is steeped in acoustic guitars and sensitive songwriting. There is new life breathed into them, a reimagining of how the tracks sound that make them fit in with the rest of the set while also retaining the fragility and emotional content from their studio versions. ‘How’, a demo from the EP that has been brought back, sets the new version of Bambi up perfectly as they transition seamlessly, the 70s-style keys having a moment to shine. In ‘Partridge’, the drums keep a steady tempo before finishing with a drum solo that helps to deliver the punch of the heartbreaking lyrics. ‘Amoeba’ is a crowd-pleaser with its ready-to-dance beat and energy, pace and excitement increasing as the song builds and builds before the final verse, once again the London fans showing their excitement as they sing the words back to Claire with intense passion.

  

When making Charm, Claire talked about revisiting her older work as a source of inspiration, and so it is fitting that the updated tracks also include hits from her EP. These are fan-favourites, and with ‘4EVER’ and ‘Flaming Hot Cheetos’ not only is that clear with their reception, but the influence is also immediately noticeable. Immunity has songs that receive some of the loudest cheers from the audience. ‘Softly’ and ‘North’ help with pacing as they appear around some of the slower songs, giving the crowd a bolt of energy and ensuring they remain engaged.

  

The final few songs feature Claire’s biggest hits. ‘Bags’ has a reception that is almost deafening, phones out en masse to record a memory that will last. ‘Sexy To Someone’ and ‘Juna’ contrast the debut album songs and showcase how far she has come and evolved as an artist. The playfulness of the performance, especially in the final tracks, shows a comfortability on stage and as ‘Sofa’ starts to play, the final song of the night, it earns the biggest reception yet as the audience use up all of their excitement as they dance and sing along.

  

The night also featured a surprise, with Claire performing a live debut of another fan favourite, ‘Steeeam’. Taken from Shelly, her side-band, the single that was made during quarantine had never been played live before, and the reception to its first-ever performance was a historic moment in Clairo history, the crowd doing justice to the surprise by singing along to every word and providing the enthusiasm it deserves.

  

The concert works so masterfully because of the intimate atmosphere, something that cannot be achieved without the stage design. Taking inspiration from 70s TV show performances, the green steps add physical layers to the stage and with the shimmering and sparkling backdrop, stage lights hid behind it, and the audience feels invited into the world of Charm. The lighting also plays a big part, with a spotlight directly above Claire that lowers itself during the slower and intimate songs to emphasise that feeling. The glimmering curtain lights up in accordance with the instruments, fully lit during loud choruses and darker/more hidden during the quieter verses. Claire is often immersed in shadows, which helps to draw you in due to the mysteriousness and intrigue of not fully knowing what she will do. She commands the stage by withholding aspects of her and the stage, the shadows being an example of this; there is a heavy influence from Mazzy Star’s Hope Sandoval in the drawn-back nature. During the faster tracks, like ‘Sofia’ or ‘Add Up My Love’, Claire dances around the stage, lights on, as she uses the command she has on the crowd to her full advantage.

  

The Charm Tour is a 21-song journey through Clairo’s discography, touching on all projects released and also the emotions and feelings from each of those projects. The updated songs sound fresh while also being faithful, and the new songs showcase her evolution as an artist and also her wide range of influences as a lover of music. With the intimate stage set-up and the mysterious, starry-night lighting, Claire is able to control the crowd with ease and also retain intrigue and suspense. This is an artist in love with her music and performing her shows to crowds that love her music and appreciate her performances; this is an artist at the top of her game.
