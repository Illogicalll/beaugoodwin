With Inhaler’s third album Open Wide, the Irish band steers further into the indie-pop sound that had been bubbling beneath the surface of their previous two records. They embrace it now with jaunty guitars and infectious bass lines that make each song feel playful.

The catchiness of the record is seen on every track, with there being moments that linger for a while in one’s mind. On the first two songs ‘Eddie In The Darkness’ and ‘Billy (Yeah Yeah Yeah)’, this ability to create joyful ear-worms is extremely prevalent; ‘Billy’ being perhaps the catchiest song on the LP. The tug-of-war for attention between the two guitars makes it a more compelling listen and adds richness to the sound, with the complex production providing extra depth – seen in the treatment of backing vocals during the chorus.

In the opener ‘Eddie In The Darkness’, there’s a contrast in tone between the verse and chorus but even during those darker choruses that feel grimier and almost claustrophobic, there is still a hook due to the tempo increase and alluring atmosphere that make it a standout track. Frontman Elijah ‘Eli’ Hewson’s vocals are greatly improved since the last album, and the small ‘imperfections’ give the songs heart; on ‘Eddie In The Darkness’, the raspiness on the bridge helps with making it so memorable and emotive.

There is an uplifting feeling to the album. With the use of Eli’s lyricism and the upbeat, 80s-influenced guitar sound from guitarist Josh Jenkinson, the group manage to weave in a real sense of positivity and hope that is heartwarming throughout. On their lead single ‘Your House’, they use (for the first time) a choir to aid in backing vocals. This addition not only enriches their sound but ensures that feeling of overwhelming positivity that feels ethereal and has an angelic, otherworldly tone as they sing.

Elijah also writes in a very observational way. It is very confessional and can often feel quite personal to listen in. On the title track he sings: “Got my arms out open wide, come on baby take a look.”, on ‘The Charms” he sings: “I want to fall into your arms, I watched him fall for your charms.” and on ‘All I Got Is You’ Eli opens with: “Yeah I stayed up too late, and now my friends have all gone.” There is a relatability to his writing, with the inspiration for these songs being grounded in everyday experiences from the obsession of early love to the ‘will they? won’t they?’ beginning of a relationship. Songs like ‘A Question Of You’ and ‘All I Got Is You’ stray into love song territory, a new style of song for the group but one that feels natural. The overall sound of the LP make the romantic tracks feel right at home.

‘X-Ray’ has a rock’n’roll vibe to it, with a Western-style guitar kicking off the track. Josh’s guitar is tuned down to drop-D, giving the chorus that necessary thud to be impactful and tie all the different parts together. The singing shines on the lines “It feels like heaven, even if there is not one, I will chain myself to your soul.” from the chorus, conveying powerful emotion which makes them feel larger than life and so rousing. The song has that classic rock feel, standing out as one to be experienced live.

‘Little Things’ triumphantly closes the LP. Similar to ‘X-Ray’ in the rock sound, especially compared to the rest of the record, the song is unrelentingly energetic. “Those little things, nothing’s going to change the way I feel about…” is sung over thundering chords, similar to their previous album’s closer ‘Now You Got Me’ in tone and sound.

Robert Keating’s bass playing has matured alongside the rest of the band and this can be seen clearly in the bass riff to this track, subtle yet so vital. The same can be applied to Ryan McMahon whose tight drumming keeps tempo for the group, allowing for the constant energy heard in all 13 tracks. Each member of the group gets moments on the album to shine with their instruments, ensuring that no song is forgettable.

Open Wide stands out as the group’s most mature body of work. Leaning into the indie-pop sound worked in the band’s favour as they created memorable songs that are both uplifting and catchy. The instrumentation is improved, with the drum and bass being subtle to allow for the guitars or vocals to shine and take centre stage while also having moments to stand out – all instruments being vital to making each track work so well. The addition of heavier, rock-influenced tracks gives the LP the edge needed, still retaining the uplifting energy while also feeling grittier. The matured songwriting shines noticeably throughout and the album works as a compelling project about love and vulnerability with some of the band’s most experimental and progressive songs yet. At the end of a listen it is readily apparent just why Inhaler are touted as one of the best modern bands right now and if their consistent output of high-quality songs is to go by, it’s hard to see that claim being challenged any time soon.
